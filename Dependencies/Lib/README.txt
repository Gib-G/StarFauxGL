The ReactPhysics3d libs are labelled x64 because when I compiled them with
Visual Studio (2019), the target platform said "x64". The VS solution was 
generated by CMake, and I think the VS "x64" configuration actually just 
generates x86 libs of ReactPhysics3d.
That being said, I think that those reactphysics3d-x64-*.lib are well suited for 
32 bits machines too.
